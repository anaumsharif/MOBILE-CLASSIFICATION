# MOBILE CLASSIFICATION 
CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image recognition tasks, including object classification, object detection, and image segmentation. 
They are widely used in computer vision, image processing, and other related fields, and have been applied to a wide range of applications, including self-driving cars, medical imaging, and security systems.
A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network sketched for processing structured arrays of data such as portrayals.
CNNs are trained using a large dataset of labeled images, where the network learns to recognize patterns and features that are associated with specific objects or classes. 
Once trained, a CNN can be used to classify new images, or extract features for use in other applications such as object detection or image segmentation.
